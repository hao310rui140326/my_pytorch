FUNCTIONS
    get_image_backend()
        Gets the name of the package used to load images
    
    get_video_backend()
    
    set_image_backend(backend)
        Specifies the package used to load images.
        
        Args:
            backend (string): Name of the image backend. one of {'PIL', 'accimage'}.
                The :mod:`accimage` package uses the Intel IPP library. It is
                generally faster than PIL, but does not support as many operations.
    
    set_video_backend(backend)
        Specifies the package used to decode videos.
        
        Args:
            backend (string): Name of the video backend. one of {'pyav', 'video_reader'}.
                The :mod:`pyav` package uses the 3rd party PyAv library. It is a Pythonic
                    binding for the FFmpeg libraries.
                The :mod:`video_reader` package includes a native c++ implementation on
                    top of FFMPEG libraries, and a python API of TorchScript custom operator.
                    It is generally decoding faster than pyav, but perhaps is less robust.
